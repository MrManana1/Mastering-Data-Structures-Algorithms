# Simple Stack Implementation in C++

This C++ program demonstrates a basic stack implementation using an array. It includes a simple `push` function to add elements to the stack.

## Features

- **Push Operation:** Adds elements to the stack and prints a confirmation message.
- **Fixed Size:** The stack is implemented with a fixed size of 5 elements.

## Code Overview

- **Stack Array:** A global array of size 5 is used to store stack elements.
- **Top Variable:** Tracks the index of the top element in the stack.
- **Push Function:** Adds a value to the stack and increments the top index.

## How to Use

The `main()` function performs the following operations:

1. Pushes the values 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 onto the stack.
2. Each push operation prints a confirmation message.

## Example Output

```
10 Pushed.
20 Pushed.
30 Pushed.
40 Pushed.
50 Pushed.
```
