# Stack Implementation in C++

This C++ program demonstrates the basic usage of the stack data structure. It performs the following operations:

- **push**: Adds elements to the stack.
- **top**: Retrieves the top element of the stack.
- **pop**: Removes elements from the stack while printing them.

## Expected Output

The program pushes several integers onto the stack, prints them in reverse order (LIFO), and shows the last element that was on top:



## Explanation

- **stack**: The standard library stack is used to store integer values.
- **push**: Adds elements to the stack in the order of insertion.
- **top**: Retrieves the topmost element.
- **pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
- **while loop**: Empties the stack while printing each element.
